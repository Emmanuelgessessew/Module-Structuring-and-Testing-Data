// Currently trying to print the string "I was born in Bolton" but it isn't working...
// what's the error ?

// console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);
// const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";

// the problem is we cannot access city of birth before initialization, here is the correct one.

const cityOfBirth = "Bolton";
console.log(`I was born in ${cityOfBirth}`);
